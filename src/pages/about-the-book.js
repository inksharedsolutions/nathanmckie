										 <h1>The Dignity of Service</h1>
									 	<p>The Power of Social Entrepreneurship</p>
								    </div>

									<p>
                                    	In 2018, Nathan published a book entitled, The Dignity of Profit: Building Community through Entrepreneurship. In it he described the call that we have as Christians to go out into the field to make a difference and the landscape that awaits those servants who do. A general approach to the way this plays out at field level was provided; but now, there has been some actual experience that we use to flesh out the process. 
									</p>

									<p>
                                    	Through a grant from a local economic development organization, Luke 16 Corp (a non-profit founded by Nathan) purchased a building and built out areas for incubated businesses. This facility also included a caf√© for training people for work focused on customer service. It is an unusual concept in that businesses get support by the Luke 16 organization. This book is about how to garner the support necessary to make projects like this be all that they can be.
									</p>

									<p>
										Jeffrey Baker is joining in this book to provide the additional perspective that will make it much richer in terms of a broader knowledge of field work. Both Nathan and Jeff have entrepreneurial backgrounds and seek to foster a better understanding of the power that can come from true service-oriented approach.
									</p>

									<p>
										Additionally, our experience has helped us understand the potholes that await anyone who seeks to step out in faith. Profit was directed toward churches, and to some degree businesspeople, who weren't that interested in either social enterprises or social entrepreneurship. So, here's the approach in Service: let's develop the notion that servants are not weak or ignorant folks who can't or won't take on such projects. As we look at what it means to be a servant leader, we hope you will find yourself imagining how you can pursue your dream or objective with this approach.
									</p>

									<p>
										Ultimately, the main focus still has to be on developing community. For we believe that only by doing so can there be a meaningful impact on helping to alleviate poverty. We will look closely at the fallacy of other programs and provide some alternatives that can be very effective.

										 <h1>The Dignity of Trust</h1>
									 	<p>Building Community through Reliability and Truth</p>
								    </div>

									<p>
										Any activities that involve associations between people require that there be an acceptable level of trust. The ability to make accurate assessments about the reliability of others will determine, over time, how trustworthy they are. While it takes a long time to build trust, it takes even longer if trust is lost. This book is designed to aid in building and maintaining healthy relationships. In doing this, we investigate several ways that trust is betrayed.
									</p>

										Nathan W. McKie, Sr. - Nathan brings a rich experience in dealing with people in various career and personal environments. His father had him selling light bulbs door-to-door which exposed him to the challenges of cold-call selling. He worked beside farm hands and was very active in the 4-H Club even winning a National contest. In college, he worked as camp counselor and sold formal favors to sororities and fraternities. After graduating college, he went into the Air Force and completed a four-year stint, reaching the rank of Captain and receiving the Air Force Commendation Medal.
									</p>

									<p>
										In 2016, after a career of entrepreneurial ventures, corporate managerial positions, and volunteer service, he founded a non-profit venture designed to foster social entrepreneurship. By creating solid relationships and building trust, it is believed that a sense of community can be achieved in urban and rural settings. The Dignity of Profit Creating Community through Entrepreneurship (2018) and The Dignity of Service: The Power of Social Entrepreneurship (2020) were published in order to inform readers about this project and to encourage them to become involved in making a difference.
