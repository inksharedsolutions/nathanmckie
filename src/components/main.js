						Nathan was born in a rural Mississippi town to Christian parents.  His maternal grandfather was a minister, and both his parents were heavily involved with their local church and with statewide organizations as well.  When Nathan was in high school, he was selected to be the president of his denominationâ€™s conference youth organization president.  This led to representing the conference youth at two national meetings.
